The Mage's Guilds
=================

In current times, mage's guilds are normally nation run organizations that are used to track and police magic users. Typically all magic users capable of 3rd level or higher are required to register. The members of these guilds often use the guilds for things such as information sharing, posting quests, finding apprentices, and as a means to enter and traverse the world of politics and high society. In times of war, it is common for Mage Guilds to draft its members into the nation's military. Because of the rules and restrictions of Mages Guilds and the watchful eyes of those who run them, it is common for magic users to form social clubs and circles that are connected but separate from the guilds. These clubs or circles provide a bit of privacy to research and discuss their work with like-minded individuals.
