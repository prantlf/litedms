Antiquarian
===========

Muttering a quick charm against rot, a grubby old man gingerly opens an ancient tome, pages oozing with dark magic.

Humming a scrap of ancient spellcraft as she ascends the ancient ziggurat, a gnome with grey streaks in her hair winches herself away from a crocodile pit.

Switching out his eye for one with a superior lens focus, a polished warforged tests the air with a thumb, eyeing the treasure trove with bemusement. Cursed, he determines. Every single piece.

Antiquarians are trained specialists in the historical, and curious workers of charms and cantrips. Varied in their talents, knacks and specialisms, an antiquarian can always be relied upon to have a trick up their sleeve.

Loreseekers And Dabblers
------------------------

Always ask the expert – that’s the creed of the antiquarian. Sages, scholars and casual hucksters, the antiquarian is defined not by their depth of knowledge but by their obsession. Collectors of clocks, baggers of baubles and testers of patience, the antiquarian can be found across all corners of the globe fiddling with something expensive and muttering about the provenance.

In their line of work, the antiquarian gains a keen sense for danger, traps and the stench of curses, using their borderline precognition to whisk away something valuable into their capacious sleeves, bags and secret compartments. Antiquarians are formidable loremasters and enviable utility specialists who combine a deep sense of professional paranoia with a dizzying array of secret weird magics unearthed from their discoveries.
