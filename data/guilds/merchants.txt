Merchant's Guild
================

Found in nearly every major city, merchant guilds allow merchants to band together to secure better goods, more favorable fees, and prices, and lobby for better treatment from their host cities. These guilds are often run by wealthy and influential merchants or a small council of merchants. Merchant guilds often compete with other merchant guilds and are known for hiring adventurers for various quests.
