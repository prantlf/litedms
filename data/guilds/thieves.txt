Thieve’s Guild
==============

The Master Thieves Guild is the Guild of Guildmasters. It is the overarching group that oversees all Thieves Guilds on the land. It is said to have existed ever since the start of thievery and rogues. An offshoot of this group was run by Snug but she gave up her power to who she has now discovered to be her father. In the shadows, he rebuilt his society of thieves and now has The Bar, the greatest echelon of thieves seen by Akeroth but the Bar is, of course, just a rumor.

Symbols & Payment
-----------------

The Masters chose a newly minted style of Gold coin as their symbol - this was later adopted by the Assassin’s Guild as a form of standard payment causing it to be more widely minted than had been anticipated. Today the Coin is used as a sign of status, and as a sign of a debt being owed to the bearer by their Guild. It is used as payment after performing missions for the Guild itself and is therefore seen as recognition of the deed by the Bar as well.

Structure
---------

The Guildmaster Collective Guild is known among Master Thieves as the Bar. Some elements of Thieves Cant reflect the presence of this group but it rarely becomes involved in the lives of the average Rogue or Footpad. Only when the balance of power between different Guildmasters becomes altered does the Bar take an active interest in local goings-on.

Culture
-------

The Bar is secretive but said to be very practical and it has been rumored that it was actually first created in a backwater bar in some long forgotten small town. Other rumors link it to the bars of a prison with the guildmasters at the time all being locked up in the same penal establishment when they first set up the goals of the organization.

Assets
------
Unknown but rumored to include a battle fleet of shadow ships that can phase in and out of existence, along with a shadow isle centered around a tavern at the end of the known world.
