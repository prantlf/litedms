================

The Traveler's Guild is a massive guild found all over the known world and is funded by the majority of the world's nations. As their name implies, members of this guild are often found traveling all over the world, either in parties or as individuals. The responsibilities of the guild members are as follows:

* Report on Titans' whereabouts and the awakening of new Titans
* Report signs of incoming hazardous weather
* Report other noted threats to the nearest guild building
* Transport Mail 
* Act as guides for those with enough coin
* Survey the land and report their findings

Because of their responsibilities, the Traveler's Guild is seen as a neutral party and protected by most nations from conflict and interference. The guild is also known to have strong ties to countless businesses and guilds the world over. There are more than a few adventurers who work part-time as members of the Traveler's Guild or take on jobs that the guild puts up.
